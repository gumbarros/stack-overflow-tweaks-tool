## Features

### Highlight the correct answer

The correct answer, if any, will be highlighted with a green background.

### Jump to the answer

If the answer is correct, a button will be added in the question header, next to the "ask a question" button. When you click the new button, the page will scroll to the correct answer.

### Improve your focus

Now you can hide the navigation and tooltip bars, so that nothing can distract you.
