## Features

### Highlight the correct answer

The correct answer, if any, will be highlighted with a green background.

### Jump to the answer

If the answer is correct, a button will be added in the question header, next to the "ask a question" button. When you click the new button, the page will scroll to the correct answer.

### Improve your focus

Now you can hide the navigation and tooltip bars, so that nothing can distract you.

## Installation

### Microsoft Edge

The extension is available on Microsoft Store [here](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/stackoverflow-tweaks-tool/njpnponmdmhbeojlcdffcliceolmambc?form=MT001Y).

### Other Chromium browsers

For other Chromium browsers, such as Google Chrome, the extension needs to be installed manually.
StackOverflow Tweaks Tool will be available on the Chrome Web Store as soon as possible.
